# EMS-mutagenesis-project
This project deals with the identification of SNPs that rescues the ssadh phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana. The _ssadh_ homozygous mutant showed abnorml phenotype. EMS mutagenesis of the ssadh seeds induced thousands of random mutations in the genome. The EMS mutation rescues the ssadh phenotype almost to a wild type level. The question is which mutation/s is/are responsible for rescuing the ssadh phenotype. Selected lines named as L7D, L13J, L17J and L21H showed an improved phenotype compared to the ssash homozygous line. QTL analysis using bi-parental crosses (col-0 with Ler ecotypes, ssadh mutant is col-o background) showed that mutations at the lower arms of chromsome 2 and five are resposnsible for suppression of ssadh phenotype. The regions were identified using PCR based markers that distinguish between the two ecotypes (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318793356_The_suppression_of_Arabidopsis_succinic_semialdehyde_dehydrogenase_SSADH_phenotype_by_using_ethyl_methane-sulfonate_mutagenesis_EMS).
The genomic DNA from these four lines were extracted and genotyped using NGS. The SNPs in the regions was further charatcterized using SQL and Python codes to select putative mutations.
